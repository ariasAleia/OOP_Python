# Object Oriented Programming in Python!


Yes! Welcome to the second part of this journey, if you haven't seen the beginning of this path, go and take a peek [here](https://github.com/ariasAleia/Learning_Python).


Now, we are in the second station. And the main character here is... Chan chan chaaan, Yap -> OOP. Object Oriented Programming.

## Learning and always learning

In this repo, I will trace and take notes of the most important and useful things I will find in this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs). Wish you a good trip. Hope you enjoy this path as much as I do :)


## Class

We can define a class and then create an instance or an object of the class. Object and instance creation mean the same.

```python
class Item:
    pass

item1 = Item()
```

Btw, the word *pass* is used when we haven't defined what is inside a function, a loop, a conditional or a class and we don't want to get a syntax error.

## Methods 

Those are basically functions that are inside a class. We must always pass as argument the object itself. That is done by writing *self* in the function parameters when we define the function. 

```python
class Item:
    def calculate_total_price(self):
        pass
```
